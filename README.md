# Work_day_scheduler

## This application is using:
* JQuery
* Momemt.js
* Bootstrap

## How it Works
* The calendar represent the workday from 9AM-5PM and the day is shown in hour time blocks.
* Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it occurs in the past (grey), present (red) or future (green).
* Each time block has an input field and 'save' button.
* Schedule can be entered to a specific hour inline, and the 'save' button saves the activity. 
* The schedule is saved even after the refresh and the user can enter the schedule in the past time as well.
